# Ti-Tech

## Description
Ti-Tech is an educational platform developed for my Ti-Tech institute, dedicated to offering a wide range of courses. The platform is designed to support students in purchasing courses, accessing a variety of learning materials in the form of PDFs and videos, and staying informed through a news feed.

## Features
- **Course Purchases:** Easily purchase courses to enhance your learning journey.
- **Access to Educational Materials:** Retrieve learning resources, including PDFs and instructional videos.
- **News Feed:** Keep up-to-date with the latest developments and announcements.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that **Node.js** and **MongoDB** are installed on your machine.
2. Install the **React Developer Tools** extension in Chrome.
3. Start MongoDB as a service. If you encounter a "refused connection" error, add the file path to your environment variables (e.g., `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<your version>\bin`).
4. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.

## Usage
To start the server, open a new terminal window and execute the following commands:
